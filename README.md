# polygon-flux
Draw polygons around FITS images and measure flux densities.

Use measure_source.py for just any old FITS file

Use measure_snrs.py for the big SNR-measuring project

defs.py holds common functions and needs to be in the same directory as both other python scripts

reproject_snrs.py is more specifically for the big SNR-measuring project
